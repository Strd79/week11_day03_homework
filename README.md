##Week 11, Day 3 homework - Intro to debugging in IDE

Answer the following questions:
####1. What is the purpose of a breakpoint?
The breakpoint is added to tell the debugger where to pause and stop running the code once you start debugging.
####2. Does the line of code on a breakpoint run when you start debugging?
No, it pauses just before running that line of code and doesn't actually run it.
####3. How do we debug the next line of code?
You can use the 'Step Over' button which will run the line of code and then pause on the next line.
####4. What does the step into command do?
This command will jump to the actual function which is being called and pause on the function so you can get more information of each step of the function, rather than just run it and move on.
####5. What is the difference between evaluate expression and evaluate code fragment?
Evaluate expression lets you call on a property and use a method on it to see what it will return. Evaluate code fragment will let you call on multiple properies and methods and even assign them to variables to see what they will run.
